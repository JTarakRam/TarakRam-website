# A Story That Opened My Mind

About a month ago, I started reading the book **"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari"** by Robin Sharma.  
If you haven’t read it yet, I highly recommend it—it’s a book that stays with you long after you’ve put it down.

One story in the book had a profound impact on me. It’s simple, yet incredibly powerful. I’ve added a bit of my perspective to make it even more relatable. Let me share it with you.

## The Young Boy and the Monk

There was a young boy, curious and eager to uncover the secrets of the universe. He was determined to gain wisdom and knowledge, so he set out on a journey to find someone who could guide him.  

After days of searching, the boy finally found a wise monk sitting peacefully under a tree.  

The young boy asked:  
> **"I want to be as knowledgeable as you are. How long will it take me to become like you?"**  

Without hesitation, the monk replied:  
> **"Five years."**

Surprised by the answer, the boy thought for a moment and asked again:  
> **"What if I work twice as hard as possible? How long would it take then?"**  

The monk calmly said:  
> **"Ten years."**

This confused the boy. Determined to speed things up, he said:  
> **"I’ll work day and night. I’ll devote every waking moment to this. How long would it take now?"**

The monk smiled and replied:  
> **"Fifteen years."**

Frustrated and angry, the boy couldn’t hold back anymore:  
> **"Why does the time increase when I’m willing to work harder and harder?"**

The monk, still smiling, explained:  
> **"If one eye focuses on the final destination, there is only one left to show you the path."**

## The Lesson That Changed My Perspective

When I read this line—  
> **"If one eye focuses on the final destination, there is only one left to show you the path."**  
—I sat silently for five minutes, just letting the message sink in.  

It made me realize something profound:  
We often focus too much on the **outcome**—the destination.  
- *"I need this car."*  
- *"I need $1M by the age of 24."*  

We obsess over these goals, forgetting that the journey is just as important, if not more so.  

But here’s the truth:  
> **The destination is not in our control. The present moment is.**

When we focus on the path—on the things we can control—we can give our best to the journey, and the results will follow naturally.

## Takeaway

This story reminded me to keep both eyes on the present moment. Instead of obsessing over where we’ll end up, let’s concentrate on what we’re doing now.  

When you focus on the process, the destination will take care of itself.
