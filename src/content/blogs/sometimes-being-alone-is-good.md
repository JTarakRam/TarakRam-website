# Sometimes, Being Alone Can Be Better Than Being Around People

I’ve learned through my own life experiences that sometimes, being alone can feel better than being around people. When I’m busy or stressed, spending time alone gives me a chance to relax, recharge, and reflect. It helps me feel calm and centered, especially after a chaotic day.


A few weeks ago, I was really busy with work and constantly surrounded by people. By the end of the week, I felt completely exhausted.  

I decided to stay in my room one evening instead of going out. I didn’t watch TV or use my phone. Instead, I just sat quietly, drank tea, and read a book. It was amazing how much better I felt after that time alone.  

When I’m alone, I don’t have to worry about other people’s opinions or make plans. It’s just me, my thoughts, and my feelings. This helps me understand myself better. I can think about what I want and what makes me happy. I don’t always need company to enjoy myself.  

But not everyone finds alone time as enjoyable. I remember hearing a quote from a podcast saying:  

> *"All problems come to men because he cannot sit quietly for 30 minutes in a room by himself."*  

It’s a reminder of how uncomfortable many people feel when they are alone with their thoughts.  

Even scientific research has been done on this topic:  

In a series of experiments, participants were asked to sit alone in a room with nothing but their thoughts for 6 to 15 minutes.  

Many found this task difficult and unpleasant, with some even preferring to administer mild electric shocks to themselves rather than endure the experience of being alone with their thoughts.  

Of course, spending time with peers is important and fulfilling. But sometimes, a little alone time is more important. It’s an opportunity to take care of yourself, reflect on your goals.  

It’s okay to enjoy being alone sometimes.
