# Who Will Cry When I Die?

Who will cry when I die? That’s an interesting question that you need to ask yourself.

It makes you pause and reflect on the relationships in your life. This thought stuck with me ever since I read a book by the same name " who will cry when I die " by Robin Sharma a year ago.

For many of us, life feels like a constant rush—working, earning money, climbing the ladder of success. But in that pursuit, we often forget to ask: *Are the people in my life truly here for me, or is it just a transaction?*

In today’s world, a lot of relationships feel transactional. People come into your life for a reason—maybe they need something from you, or you need something from them. And once that “transaction” is complete, they’re gone.

A few years ago, I was solely focused on myself. I didn’t prioritize relationships—neither with family nor friends. But time doesn’t stay the same forever. During COVID, when I was at my lowest, neither my career nor money mattered. What truly mattered was taking care of myself, my family, my friends, and my close relationships.

That was also when I realized something painful—some people I thought would be there for me simply weren’t. They didn’t care, they didn’t check in, and they didn’t show up. It was then that I understood how fragile some relationships are. They weren’t built on love, trust, or genuine care—they were built on what we could offer each other. And once that was gone, so was the relationship.

Deep down, we all crave love and genuine connection. But we often neglect these bonds while chasing success. I’ve spent so much time working, sacrificing moments with family and friends, thinking I had time. And then one day, I lost someone I loved. Suddenly, I was left alone, questioning why I hadn’t spent more time with them when I had the chance.

That moment taught me something crucial: Life isn’t just about work or money. It’s about the people who truly care about you—the ones who stand by you through everything.

So, when you die, who will truly feel the loss? Who will sit and cry, wondering how life will go on without you?

The answer isn’t always who you expect. It’s not necessarily the people you spend the most time with or those involved in a transactional relationship. It’s the ones who genuinely love you—your family, your partner, your closest friends.

The lesson here is simple: Don’t take relationships for granted. Spend time with the people who truly matter. Be fully present when you’re with them. Don’t get so consumed by work and money that you neglect the ones who truly care.

Looking back now, I wish I had realized this sooner. I wish I had invested more time in relationships built on love rather than convenience.

So, ask yourself: *Who will cry when I die?* The answer might surprise you. And if it’s not who you want it to be, it’s not too late to change that.

Life is short. Don’t waste your time on people who are only around for what they can gain. Focus on those who truly care and make time for them.

In the end, it’s not about the money you made or the success you achieved—it’s about the people who will truly miss you when you’re gone.

Let’s make sure those people are the ones who truly love us.
