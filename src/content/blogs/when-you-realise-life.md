## When You Realize That You Have Only One Life to Live

## The Importance of Health

One of the important lessons that I’ve learned recently is about **“Life.”** Anything can wait, but your health won’t, so take care of your body.  
**It’s the only place that you have to live.**

> **Read it again**: Take care of your body. It’s the only place that you have to live.

## A Visit to the Cancer Hospital

Recently, I went to the Cancer Hospital for some reason, and I saw a lot of people who had cancer. Some were crying, some had no idea what was going on, some were worried, and some were joyful. It was a strange experience for me.

One thing I can’t remove from my mind is I saw a kid who was about 11-13 years old. The doctors had removed her hair, and she was upset, crying, and hugging her father. I still remember that visual, and it’s really hard to forget. I don’t know why this happened to these kids who hadn’t even lived much of their lives. I had a feeling that this was why God was so harsh on them.

## The Realization

After seeing those visuals in the hospital, my mind completely opened up. No matter how much money you have, if you don't have good health, then it's all a waste.

### Think of this:

You have millions of dollars, but you can't eat whatever you want, you can't walk for some distance, and you always feel ill. Personally, I don’t think you’ll be happy. Everyone says money is important, and I truly agree with that, but after a certain stage, health is the most important thing.  
As I said before:  
**Take care of your body. It’s the only place that you have to live.**

## Living a Happy Life

We don’t know when we are going to die, but as long as we live on this earth, we should live a happy life.

This is a quote that I really love reading every day. My father always said:

> *“You will never hear anyone on their deathbed say, ‘I wish I had worked more.’”*

Personally, this quote hits me harder than anything. Back then, I used to sleep at 2 AM or 3 AM every day because of work, but nowadays, I give more priority to my health. I’m getting enough sleep and eating healthy food.

## The Hard Truth

One thing I want to say is that one day, you will realize that you wish you hadn’t worked so hard.

> **Don’t make your life so hard; keep it simple and easy.**

I know most people won't read this, but there is a small hope in me that even one person can read this and it might be helpful in their life. That’s enough for me.

Thanks. :)

**Btw**, take care of your health.
