# When You Realize That You Have Only One Life to Live

## The Importance of Health

One of the most profound lessons I’ve learned recently is about **life itself**. No matter how busy or ambitious you are, your health should always come first.  
**Your body is the only place you have to live.**  

> **Read it again**: Take care of your body. It’s the only place you have to live.

## A Visit to the Cancer Hospital

A recent visit to a cancer hospital left a lasting impression on me. I saw people from all walks of life battling cancer—some crying, some confused, some worried, and a few even finding moments of joy. It was a surreal and humbling experience.

One image I can’t erase from my mind is that of a young girl, around 11-13 years old. Her hair had been removed due to treatment, and she was crying inconsolably in her father’s arms. That moment shook me to my core. Why do children, who have barely begun to live, face such hardships? It felt like an inexplicable cruelty of life.

## The Realization

That day, something shifted in me. I realized that no amount of wealth or success can compensate for poor health.  

### Think about this:  

You could have millions in the bank, but if you can’t enjoy a meal, walk freely, or live without pain, would you truly be happy? Money is important, yes, but beyond a certain point, health becomes the most valuable asset.  

As I said earlier:  
**Take care of your body. It’s the only place you have to live.**

## Living a Happy Life

We don’t know how much time we have on this earth, but while we’re here, we should strive to live a happy and fulfilling life.  

One of my favorite quotes, which my father often shared, is this:  

> *“You will never hear anyone on their deathbed say, ‘I wish I had worked more.’”*  

This quote has stayed with me and changed my perspective. I used to stay up until 2 or 3 AM every night, sacrificing sleep for work. Now, I prioritize my health—getting enough rest, eating well, and taking time to recharge.  

## The Hard Truth

Here’s a hard truth: One day, you might look back and wish you hadn’t worked so hard.  

> **Don’t overcomplicate your life. Keep it simple and meaningful.**  

I know not everyone will read this, but if even one person finds it helpful, that’s enough for me.  

Thank you for reading.  

**P.S.** Take care of your health—it’s the greatest gift you can give yourself.
