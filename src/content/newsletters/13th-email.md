# Hello,

I’m feeling super tired, but anyway, I am writing this newsletter at 1 AM.

Happy Monday. You are beautiful, energetic, and motivated. I hope this week will bring you joy and get what you deserve; this was the wish that I put forth as a new resolution. I didn’t set any goals; I just said that I need not do anything new; if I just continue doing the things that I am doing right now, it would be enough, but I need to be consistent and get what I deserve and I hope you get what you deserve.

## This week was fun.  
I learned a lot by talking to people, reading books, and from my personal experiences.

I met a founder this week who has been in the industry for five years; we talked about a lot of things about business, products, relationships, markets, etc.…

He suggested I should meet more girls and start dating them; I said I was not comfortable talking with them.

I told an incident where a few of my friends and I sat at 3 AM one day and talked about all the relationships and their love stories, and they suggested to me,  

> **Tarak, we are telling you from our personal experience: at this age, love is just a distraction, and you waste a lot of time. First, go and earn money. And even if you want to marry any girl, without thinking about religion or color, you should have the money first.**  

> **If you have money, your Dad won’t talk about anything, and even your partner's parents won't talk about anything once you are earning a good amount of money.**  

And I was like, _Hmm, Okay…_

To be honest, in terms of relationships, I live in a fantasy where I was always dreaming about Sita (_I don’t know how many times I watched Sita Ramam Movie_), but when I see them in the real world, it is really, really difficult to find people like them, and it was like a fantasy for me.  

When they shared their personal stories, it hit me hard because I could see it from my friends' experiences.  

It's good to have a girlfriend or boyfriend if there is a good intention. Otherwise, you are wasting your productive time.

You can get more money by improving your skills or doing another job, but you can’t get more time.  

I used to regret doing nothing during the time of Corona; I used to play **PUBG all day long for 7 - 10 hours.** If I had utilized that time, I would have been on another level by now.  

Thankfully, I realized this earlier, so now I am working on myself.

## DeleMate & Investment Conversations  
Coming back to the meetup with the founder—when I was talking about **DeleMate**, he was impressed with the idea and said:  

> **"If I have the money, I will invest in it."**  

This was not the first time I had heard this. A few people have told me they would love to invest in the idea that I am working on.  

One of my team members even said he would introduce me to some **investors in Bangalore**, so I am going to **Bangalore this month.**  

Let’s see what happens. I’m kind of excited.  

**The app is ready to upload to the App Store and Play Store.** We have tested it, and everything seems to be working well.  

Let’s see what happens—this might be the next million-dollar company, or it might fail.  

**Who knows?**  

But one thing is certain: _I am going to learn a lot from this journey._

## The Book I’m Reading 📖  
I started reading **The Millionaire Fastlane** book, and it's really good.  

One of the major things about being wealthy is the **mindset of the person**—you can’t be rich with a poor mindset.  

You don’t need fancy education, and you don’t need to know a lot of things.  

In this book, he clearly explains:  

- The **mindset of the rich** vs. **the mindset of the poor**  
- One thinks of **value**, another thinks of **cost**  
- One thinks of **risks**, another thinks of **mutual funds**  

I just started three days ago. Let me dig deep into this book so that I can explain more, but if you are interested in reading,  

> **I have a PDF version of this book. If you want it, email me why you want to read this book at: jtarakram6699@gmail.com**

## A Realization About People & Priorities  
One of the things I noticed in myself is that I show a lot of interest and curiosity when meeting a person for the first time, but gradually, it fades.  

This was not the first time.  

When I first met someone online, I was really inspired to talk and was very interested. But as time went by, I didn’t feel that same enthusiasm.  

The same thing happened with a few other people too.  

As time goes by, **priorities shift.**  

> **Did that happen to you?**

## Just ASK  
If you want to do something, **honestly, there are a lot of people willing to help you.**  

It only takes **one message** to ask and get help.

A lot of people helped me in terms of:  

- Clarity  
- Finance  
- Work  
- Skills  
- Network  
- Relationships  
- And a lot more...  

There is an old saying:  

> **Even your mother won’t feed you until you ask.**  

How can a person know what you want **until you say it?**  

- If you want **Clarity, ASK.**  
- If you want **a job, ASK.**  
- If you want **money, ASK.**  

But **be honest with yourself**—that is the biggest favor you can do for yourself.  

There will be times in life when you don't have clarity about what to do and how to do it. But if you stay **honest with yourself**, you will find a way.

## Don’t Play Safe  
You might say,  

> **"Tarak, I need to earn money. My parents trust me to take care of them."**  

I completely agree with you.  

But your **20s is the age to explore and try different things**—it is NOT the time to settle into an ordinary job and do it for the next 40 years.  

It is the time to **experience and figure out what you are truly passionate about** because you don’t have hard responsibilities until you are **25 or 26**.  

You might ask, **"How do I feed my family?"**  

I want to be really honest with you—don’t get me wrong:  

> **If they can pay for your college fees and expenses, I’m pretty sure they can take care of themselves without needing you—at least until they have the energy.**  

Imagine getting a job, buying a car + house, and then **spending the next 40 years paying EMIs.**  

And even if you wanted to **exit and start something you are passionate about**, you **couldn’t**—because you have to pay your EMIs and expenses.  

I hope this got you thinking about your life.  

> **Great rewards come from great risks.**

The only request I have is:
