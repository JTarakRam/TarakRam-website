## **Our First Email**

Hey there!

First of all, **thank you** for signing up for **Monday Mornings**, where I share everything I’ve learned this week.  
You’re awesome! 🙌

> Actually, I forgot to schedule this newsletter 😅 (I’ve been traveling the whole week—currently in Delhi, more about this in the next newsletter). So here it is, sent ASAP!

### **About Me**

Since this is our first email, let me introduce myself.  
I’m **Tarak Ram**, an entrepreneur and podcast host at _The Tarak’s Show_. I live in a small village called Jonnalagadda.

Here’s the deal:

- I don’t have a fancy background or an Ivy League education.
- All I have is my laptop, an internet connection, and the passion to make something great.

I’m the founder of **Skale With AI**, helping businesses bring in more customers, and co-founder of **DeleMate**, a peer-to-peer delivery app.

### **Why Should You Read This Newsletter?**

Here’s what I bring to the table:

- **Daily Reading Habit**: I read books and share summaries with you.
- **Talking to Founders**: Every week, I talk to at least 1-2 startup founders.
- **Podcasting**: I host podcasts and listen to TED talks.

In this newsletter, you’ll find:

1. Weekly learnings.
2. Book summaries.
3. Lessons from amazing people I meet.
4. Tools and resources I’ve discovered.
5. Mistakes I’ve made (so you can avoid them!).

If you’re too busy to read books or watch podcasts, don’t worry—I’ll summarize everything for you.

This week was packed with amazing interactions:

- I recorded a podcast with **Dane and Tracy**, who are running multiple startups.

### Key Insights:

  - To maintain good relationships, _never mix personal and professional life._

### **Book Summary: "Million Dollar Weekend"**

This week, I finished reading _Million Dollar Weekend_, and it’s a must-read for early-stage startup founders.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Validate Before Building**:
   - Don’t assume people will use your product—test and validate if they’re willing to pay for it.
2. **Start with Customers**:
   - Get feedback, reverse-engineer your product, and adapt as you go.
3. **Enjoy Life**:
   - Life isn’t just about making money. Explore new things and avoid regrets.
