Hey Buddy,

Yes, I’m turning 22 in the next two days, and I can’t believe how fast this year went by. It was an amazing experience for me, and I learned a lot of lessons along the way.

I’m just going to be honest with you and want to talk about both the good and bad sides so that you will understand better.

## First, Let’s talk about the Bad things First:

- I’ve felt many times that I have no idea what I am doing, and sometimes I can’t see any clear path.
- I doubted many times whether it was the right thing to do and if it was right for me.
- Due to a lot of projects in my head, there is plenty of mental pressure on me, and I am not able to concentrate fully.
- I failed to take care of my health; I always used to say that you should take care of your body because it’s the only place you have to live... but due to city life and some circumstances, I failed to take care of my health.
- I felt sad many times that I was not able to send the money to my family so that they could reduce the work that they were doing.
- One of my regrets is that I still don’t have a girlfriend.

You might think these are just small problems when we compare them to others, but I just make it overall. When I say mental pressure, you never know what’s going on in my mind; even now, while writing this newsletter, something is going on in my mind. But yeah, every life has problems and doesn’t go as planned.

If life goes as planned, what is the specialty? Life is full of surprises.

## Let’s talk about the good things as well:

- I started a lot of projects with enthusiasm and tried to consistently put in the effort and slowly move forward. This was one of the best things about me—I consistently put in effort, even though it was small, but it made a huge difference in the long run.
- I had the pleasure of meeting more than **40+ founders** and got some good advice from them.
- I started writing a **diary**; this was one of the best decisions that I made.
- I try to be mentally stable. I don’t know when I was last angry; even my mom said that my anger was completely dead, and now I have become a cool person.
- Went on a **Tour**.
- I started helping people through **podcasts and newsletters**.
- I have a lot of confidence that I’m going to be successful in life by just doing these things consistently.
- **Able to employ a few folks.**

If you are someone who is always worried about goals and the future, I am also one of the guys with you because I always think about the future and forget to live in the present.

One of the best things that I’ve done is **start reading books and writing a diary**; yes, I can proudly say that **books changed my life**.

I used to think when I saw a video of a guy saying how books changed his life, "That can’t be true." But now I can see that random YouTube video in my personal life.

Just start reading **one book**, and you will see the difference. You will get a lot of information and experience for just **200 rupees**.

### These are the things that I’ve achieved in just **9 months**:

- **Podcasting**: I started doing podcasts with some great people, and now I’m in the **top 1% of podcasters in the world** because many podcasters never finished **20+ episodes**, but I did.
- **Newsletter Writing**: I started writing a **Newsletter**, sharing my thoughts and journey, and I get some **good responses** from people, meaning there are people who genuinely read what I write on the internet.
- **App Development**: I started developing an **app**, and now it is **uploaded to the App Store and Play Store** (currently in review).
- **Offline Business**: I started an **offline business** in **three months**, generating **six-figure revenue**.
- **Diary Writing**: I started writing a diary this year and wrote almost **every day**, and it became a **habit** for me.
- **First Flight & Kedarnath**: I flew on a plane for the first time; I visited **Kedarnath** and enjoyed it a lot.
- **Partnering with a UK Scientist**: I partnered with a **UK senior scientist** to build a **web app**, and we **made it happen** and released it to the public.
- **Clients & Business**: I have some **good clients** who are willing to pay for the use of my service.
- **Networking**: Met a lot of people, had countless meetings, and experienced **both fun and struggles**.
- **Reading More**: Read more than **24+ books**.
- **Job Offers**: Had **three job opportunities**.

All these were done in just **under nine months**—imagine what **2 years, 5 years, or 10 years** of consistent effort can achieve.

See, **things take time**; if you are **consistent** and try to reach your goal **day by day, slowly**, you will be successful.

Oh no, I went into motivation! 😆 I always say that **don’t rely on motivation** because it won’t last long. When you want to do something hard, one of the best things you can do is **share that with the public** and your **friends and family**. When you feel like avoiding it, this public promise will **remind you** that you have to do it. Maybe that’s why marriages are done in front of a lot of people.
