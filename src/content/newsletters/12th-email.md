## Hello Everyone,

How is your week?

I would really love to hear how your week went and what things you are working on; if possible, let’s catch up sometime online and share your thoughts.

This week, I had some wild thoughts and learned a few lessons, such as that I should care for myself first rather than anyone else and I’m sadly saying that I’m not spending much time with my family. It has been more than two months since I met my parents, even though it’s just a 5-hour journey, still I am not able to go and spend some time with them.

I’m just thinking on paper—am I really busy or just acting like I am busy?

## Highlights of this week 💫

This week I didn’t have much to say but yeah, it was good:

- Watched cartoons after a long time.
- Started reading three books this week. I don’t know if I’ll get bored, so I’m switching to another book, but yeah, they are really good.
- Got the opportunity for the podcasts where guests would pay some money to be on my podcast.
- Moved to a hostel; now I have more free time to work on things that matter.
- Called most of my friends.

## Learnings of the Week 🌱

Three days back, I got a call from an unknown number. If you ask my friends, they will say I never pick up calls from unknown numbers, even if they call five times. But I lifted that call.

I didn’t hear any "hello" from the other side, so I started the conversation: *Who is this?* He said his name was "*******"; I felt happy that it was my friend, and he called me after a long time. I just started, *What the heck are you doing, man? Where are you?*

He said he was in Kasi. I thought he was on a tour since he does pooja a lot, so he went for darshan. I asked again, *What are you doing, man?* He said he was doing meditation. I laughed, *Not now, man, what are you working on?* He said again he was doing meditation.

His voice was low, and I could feel that he was too low and kind of in a problem. Suddenly, I asked if everything was okay. He said he needed 500 rupees. I said, *Okay, I’ll send it, but are you okay? And what are you doing in Kasi?*

He again said he was doing meditation and that they would give him free food at the ashram. At that moment, I was shocked.

A year back, he called me and said, *Tarak, there are no jobs, and I don't know what to do.* He said he was going for some work that was not at all related to his studies, but he kept going. I don’t know what happened, but after one year, I got a call, and he said he was in Kasi and had become a monk.

I asked one thing: *Why didn’t you call me before making the decision? I’m here, man. Recently, I even hired a random person and am paying an 18k salary. If you needed help, I would have definitely helped.*

Life is all about making decisions, and I told him, *If you make a decision, you shouldn't feel regret in the future.*

I asked him, *What about your mom and dad?* He said, *My brother will take care.*

*Of course, man, he will take care… but after 10 years, your brother will get married, have two kids, and enjoy life. If you see that, I don’t know about you, but I would feel regret because we only live about 60 years, and we should explore and experience everything as much as we can.*

I asked him, *Is there any problem… are you suffering from something or what?* But I didn’t get any reply from him.

Generally, people don’t make this kind of decision without a strong reason behind it, but yeah, I don’t know that.

I couldn’t stop thinking about him since we’ve been in college together for three years.

I respect his decision because I know he is not a dumb person to make silly decisions. There might be a strong reason, but yeah, we have to try our best to solve the issue. He should have called me back then, or even I should have called him so that this wouldn’t have happened.

I feel really bad about myself because I was so busy acting like I didn’t even have time to call my friends and ask what they were doing.

This is not the right way. Everyone has time, and no one is busy all day. I dedicate about three hours to this newsletter every week—maybe I can cut 30 minutes and call him. It’s all about priorities, and after knowing that I couldn’t help him when he was in need, I feel so bad.

One of the biggest lessons of this week—and it will be remembered for a long time—is to please call your friends and family and maintain healthy relationships. Because in this business world, they are genuine people who don’t expect anything from you.

It feels kind of strange because a few of my classmates have gotten married, had kids, secured good jobs, pursued master’s degrees, or are just roaming here and there. Life is moving so fast… can’t we slow it down and experience it?

People are so obsessed with chasing money that they forget to ask this one simple question: *What’s the point of life, and why am I here?* Is it just to run for money, earn crores, and die? Or to experience and enjoy life?

At the end of the day, it’s all about your story… When you are old and telling stories to your grandchildren, they won’t care if you say, *I earned 100 crores of rupees.* But they will listen when you tell them about the silly things you did in college or the strange and funny experiences you had with your friends. Those are the memories that money can’t buy.

It was really good, man. I thought I’d write something small, but it ended up like this… I feel so present at this moment, motivated, and reminiscing about old memories. I wish I had a few more years of childhood—where I used to watch Tom & Jerry (*I still watch now*), play Hide and Seek, and Cricket. I don’t know how this newsletter is helping you, but it helps me a lot.

Let me know if it really helps you 🙂
