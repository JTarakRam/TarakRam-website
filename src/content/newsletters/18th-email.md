# Hey Friends,

How are you? How was your week, and what are you working on? I really want to know what you’re doing, what you’re thinking about, what you're struggling with, and what you're dealing with. If you have time, please write me an email or a message. I'm just here to build stronger and more meaningful relationships—like watering a plant so it grows and blooms.

To be honest, I have a lot of free time… well, not really. I’m making a lot of free time by not doing things that don’t matter. So, I’ve been having many deep conversations with myself—thinking. Sometimes, I feel like an author, sometimes a philosopher, sometimes even a scientist. I’ve started learning physics and listening to Richard Feynman’s lectures. Other times, I feel like a spiritual person. It’s really been a great experience.

This week, I attended three events and met a few interesting people. I’m learning, sharing experiences, and building relationships with other like-minded individuals.

## 🔥 Highlights:

- Published a podcast.  
- Attended three events.  
- Started exercising and eating proper food (which most of my friends and family wanted me to do).  
- I’m giving myself enough time.

## 📖 Learnings:

Technically, I’m now reading about five books, and whenever I get bored, I switch to another one.

I’m currently reading:

1. *Principles* by Ray Dalio  
2. *The Mindset*  
3. *Six Easy Pieces*  
4. *7 Strategies for Wealth & Happiness*  
5. *5 Major Pieces of the Life Puzzle*  

And I’m telling you, these five books are just amazing! You’ll learn a lot. Some books make you feel like the author is sitting right next to you, telling you their story.

I consider myself a great student of Jim Rohn (I call myself his student) because he’s the only one I truly trust, and he completely changed my life philosophy.

> *“It’s not what you get that is valuable; it’s what you become.”*  

Today, I had a conversation with a few folks who were thinking about taking jobs that don’t align with their background or interests. I told them:  
*"See, let’s say you take a job as a data scientist instead of a marketer. It’s not about what you get; it’s about what you become. Here, you’re becoming a data scientist instead of a marketer. Forget about the salary, reputation, or anything else—just focus on yourself."*

It’s not really about what you get; **it’s about what you become.**  

If you join an institution or a company, you should think: *I’m becoming a software engineer*—not *I’m getting perks, salary hikes, etc.* because those things don’t add long-term value.

I got a little distracted because I used to listen to Jim Rohn’s talks every day. Anyway...

There’s not much to say about learnings in this newsletter because most of this week was just me with myself—having deep conversations within.

Since I have a good amount of free time, the author in me is emerging. I’m coming up with meaningful quotes, thinking deeply, and looking at ordinary things from a different perspective—an author’s perspective. It feels great.

For example, if you read a book—let’s take my favorite, *The Almanack of Naval Ravikant*, which I’ve read five times—when I open it now, it feels like I’m reading it for the first time. That’s because my perception, situations, and circumstances have changed since the last time I read it.

> *You see the world through your perception. If you feel good, the world appears beautiful. If you’re in a bad mood, the world feels dark and weird.*

## 🤔 Question for you 🫵  
**What Does My Enough Life Look Like?** *(Ask yourself this question.)*  

If you gain clarity on this, you won’t chase after unnecessary things.

## 🎙️ Podcast  

This week, I had a podcast with **Yash Gawde**, an entrepreneur who has made significant strides in the tech and NFT spaces.  

Yash founded **Elite NFT** (valued in crores), **That’s A 10** (which he scaled to ₹3 lakh per month in just 60 days), and now leads **BeHooked**, an AI-powered content automation platform.

## 💙 Favourite Quotes  

I’ve written a few quotes of my own—these aren’t taken from or read anywhere else on the internet:  

- *The best teacher never teaches you everything. They may seem like they barely care about you, but they care for you the most.*  
- *A man who lands on this Earth must learn how to pass time.*  
- *Sometimes, not doing much is actually doing more.*  
- *I feel I’m special, and so are you—we’re all here to make this world a beautiful place.*
