## **You’re Awesome,**

Actually, I forgot to schedule the newsletter😅 (since I’m traveling this whole week… right now I’m at Delhi, more about this later in our next newsletter), so sending it now ASAP!

First of all, I really want to thank you for signing up for **Monday Mornings**, where I will share all of what I learned this week in this newsletter.

One thing I can promise you is that you won’t regret signing up for this newsletter, and I’ll give my 100% to make it more useful and helpful for the readers.

## **About Me**

This is our first email, right?

So, let me tell you a bit more about myself.

I’m **Tarak Ram**, an entrepreneur and podcast host at _The Tarak’s Show_. I live in a village called Jonnalagadda. I don’t have a fancy background or a good education; the only things that I have are my laptop with the Internet and my passion for doing something.

I’m the founder of **Skale With AI**, where we help businesses bring more customers, and I’m co-founder of **DeleMate**, a peer-to-peer delivery App.

## **Why Should You Read This Newsletter?**

I habituated reading every single day, and I at least speak to 1 or 2 founders a week, and I do podcasts and listen to podcasts and TED talks.

I’ll share all the learning in the week, the books that I read, the lessons that I’ve learned from the people that I talk to, the podcasts that I do and watch, and the resources and tools that I explored and find helpful.

If you are a busy person and don't have the time to read books and watch podcasts, I’ll send you a summary of the books that I read every week and the lessons that I’ve learned from the people.

One of the best things here is I’ll mention all the mistakes that I’ve made so that you will learn from my mistakes.

## **Learnings of the Week**

This week, I had the pleasure of meeting with some great people who have been in the startup industry for more than 15 years. Also, I did a podcast with **Dane and Tracy**, who are running multiple startups and learned a lot about finding the right team and time management.

One thing I really love about them is they spend a good amount of time with family & friends and do the things that they are really good at.

This week, I got some **brutal relationship advice** from my friends, which changed my whole perception regarding love & relationships. To be honest, I’m getting afraid.

Sometimes, even the people you trust might betray you for money. If you want to maintain a good relationship with others, my advice is **never to combine your personal and professional life**.

## **Book Summary**

This week, I read **_Million Dollar Weekend_**, and I would say it's one of the best books that every early-stage startup founder should read.

All focus on things about leverage, investments, and a lot more.. but this book shows the **basic fundamentals** and the things that every entrepreneur should have so that they **fail fast and fail cheaply**.

- Never build a product you believe that people will use; always **validate your idea** and test whether people are willing to pay for your service or not. At the end of the day, you need to make some money out of it.
- Go out and **ask your customers to get feedback** and work on that feedback; this is the best way to build the right product.
- Always **start with your customer and reverse engineer** the things so that you can learn a lot while you are building.
- It also focuses on **personal life**; life is not only about earning money; you should enjoy your life because you have only one.
- **Never regret doing, and always try to explore new things.**
