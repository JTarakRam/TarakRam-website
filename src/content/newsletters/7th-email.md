# Mid-Year Newsletter: Time Flies!

Hi Friends,

We finished 6 months in 2024. DAMN, it was like a month for me. Time moves really fast. I can’t believe that we finished 6 months, bruh, there are only 6 months left, get ready, my friend, there are some things that you promised that you would do this year.

## Highlights of This Week 💫

- Attended a 3-day workshop on business.
- Attended a meeting on productivity by Ali Abdaal.
- Watched the *Kalki* movie; it was good.

One of the things that hit me so hard, and I have to admit, is that I have no clarity in my business. I know I'm doing the work, but for what? One of the biggest questions that I always ask is whether you really enjoy doing it; if not, think twice before you go deep.

## Learnings of the Week 🌱

- It's easier to build big things with white-collar people than blue-collar people. Don't get me wrong, since I'm talking from personal experience, I'm having really bad experiences with these people. They tell lies, don't do work properly, they don't respond, and lot more.

- I learned that whenever you're running a business or want to run a business, or even want to do a job, be crystal clear with your goals. Money is not the goal for everyone out there; there are some people who need satisfaction, some need motive, and some might need another thing. But be clear about your goals because that is the most important thing; if you don’t know what you really want, then it’s really hard to achieve it.

## Random Thoughts 🫠

Let’s say you are going to die by the end of the next week; what do you do?

If I am going to die next week, I probably travel and spend most of the time with my family and friends. If I don’t have the money, I even sell my land to get money to travel and explore some of the things that I can.

If you know that you are going to die next week, there are two kinds of people:

1. The first kind seems like I’m going to die anyway, so in these remaining days, I’ll do whatever I really want to do and spend my time where I really care about. [This is the life that they need.]
2. The second kind worries that they are going to die and do nothing for the whole week.

See if you match this to your personal life, you can improve a lot.

## Book Summary 📖

This week, I didn’t have a chance to read any book; I just went through a book called “Think Like A Monk” and read a few quotes that I really loved that I highlighted back then.
