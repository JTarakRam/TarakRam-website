## Hi,

I just want to know how many people are genuinely reading my newsletters. For those, I would love to meet you online sometime this week after 9 pm till next Sunday.

You can share your ideas and thoughts and have fun talking with me; I’m more funny and cool in meetings, so if you are interested, then message me over WhatsApp - **6305184659** (this is my personal number).

I just want to be very honest with everyone, even myself. Sometimes, if you see it technically, I say that we should take care of our health and spend time with family and friends.

And it is totally true, but even I can’t do it sometimes; over this past week, I ate my lunch at **3:00 PM, 5:00 PM,** and one day at **6:45 PM**. You know how hard it is, and getting a good amount of pressure from work, but still, I’ll try to enjoy the things that I am doing.

One day, I thought about why I take things personally, so I sat down and wrote them down clearly on paper. From then till now, even though I have problems, I personally don’t take anything, so I’m more peaceful now.

I’m not perfect, and I don’t know a lot of things; I don’t know if they are good or not, but I really don’t focus on the output. Now I’m working on a few projects, but I never think of how it will be in the next ten months or what, I only focus on the present moment and love to work at my own pace.

Sometimes I work till **4 AM**, sometimes I don’t work at all for a full day, and I think only a few people have seen me closely. Recently, I’m getting emails saying, *"You are working so much, take rest Tarak,"* but that’s not true; I too enjoy a lot. I go out and chill, watch movies, read books, and spend time doing nothing. I have been thinking of playing **PUBG** this week; let’s see.

### I just want to talk about two things in this newsletter:

1. **Habit**
2. **Happiness**

#### Habit

When I was talking with a friend of mine, we discussed habits. I said I never had a feeling like I should have a six-pack or something; I always wanted to be fit and energetic. For that, I don’t need to hit the gym every day; I just need to do simple exercises daily with good food habits.

I’ve seen a good amount of people who study so hard to get a seat in their dream college or university. Once they get it, they just chill and forget what they are doing. You can visualize it if you are someone here.

I put it this way: **habit is something that you do every day**. If you set a goal to have a six-pack or to get a rank, that will be done in some time, but what do you do after getting that? Do you again fall back into a fat body?

Most people take habit like a goal, but it won’t work like that in the long term. Once you achieve that, you don’t have the motivation or desire to be consistent.

That is why most people who get a rank or six-pack will quickly go back to their previous position because they see the habit as a goal, and when they reach it, they don’t have the motivation to move forward.

So, If you want to develop a habit, **don’t look at it as a goal**. It’s a task that you do every day, even if you lose or win.

#### Happiness

If you keep materialistic things in the first place for your happiness, then I promise you will never find true happiness. Think of this: *Let’s say I’ll be happy when I have a big house or earn one CR per year.*

I’m just going a bit philosophical, and truly, we don’t know when we are going to die. I just saw a video yesterday where a student died of a heart attack in class, so life is unpredictable. You never know what’s going to happen tomorrow.

I can’t wait until I buy a house or earn one crore per year. **F*** this.** No one knows what will happen tomorrow; what you can control is **today**, and when you are alive, be happy and spend time on things that you truly love.

Never depend on another person for happiness; *"if that girl says yes, then only I’ll be happy"*—who the heck is she to decide your happiness? **If you want to be happy, you can be happy at any time.**

This week, I am more peaceful than my previous week because I decided not to take things personally. I saw a movie, I went to **Charminar, Tank Bund**, and spent the whole night on the roads. It was a good experience, and you could try it out.

I started reading the book, *“How to Stop Worrying and Start Living.”* I just started two days ago, but I’m following most of the things that have been told in this book without reading it; I don’t know how I am doing these without knowing these.

One of the things is I wrote what was the **worst case** that happened to me, and after writing that, my worry was **50% down** since I knew what to do if my plans failed.

I don’t remember when I wrote this in my Notion, maybe 4 - 5 months back, but till now, I’ll go through what I read to get a reflection on my plans and goals.

I think I should start teaching people how to be happy and do the things that they really love 😅. Let me know… message me over **WhatsApp**. I’m waiting for your message.

I know I’m very busy, but I promise I’ll listen to your problems, ideas, and all your thoughts and give my genuine reviews to you with all the books that I’ve read so far.
