# Hey,

I hope you are waiting for my newsletter to come on Monday, but I delayed it since I was busy with some other stuff. I should dedicate some time to this, but things happen without any plan.

Last week, I followed how my ideal calendar, which I would love to be, and it works like magic. When you allocate the time and are committed to following your calendar, then you will at least start doing and make some progress; that's what happens with me.

One of the biggest things that keeps me thinking about what I really want? Is it money, is it healthy relationships, is it peace, is it happiness, or something else? I am just searching for it like anything. ( I‚Äôll try to find the answers next week )

Now literally, I‚Äôm watching videos on how it feels like to be rich, what are the advantages of being rich, and are the rich people happy; and reading some books like *Man's Search for Meaning*.

I don‚Äôt think I can add much value to this newsletter, so see ya next week.
