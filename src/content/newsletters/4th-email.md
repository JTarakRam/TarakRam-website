# Hello Everyone, How are you?

This week, I’ve seen a completely different world; I spent the whole day in the cancer hospital for some reason. I’ve seen people crying and suffering, with sad faces, faces with hope, and faces with fear. It’s a strange experience for me.

I want to start from the beginning of the week.

I finished reading the book “Who Will Cry When You Die” by Robin Sharma. and watched two TED talks, which made me realize that I’m making my life hard and complex rather than keeping it simple.

I don’t want to impress anybody, and I don’t care what other people think about me. I want to be happy by being myself.

These days, I’ve realized that I’m wasting a lot of my productive time doing nothing; this doesn’t mean I’m just simply scrolling something; NO, I’m giving my inputs from my side, but from the other side is just lazy people, so because of that I’m simply wasting 4 - 5 hours every day.

This week, I went to a cancer hospital for some reason, and I spent the whole day there; I saw people who were crying, and I saw people who didn’t have legs, Arms, and mouths due to cancer.

One thing I can’t remove from my mind is I‘ve seen a kid who is like 11 - 13 years old; the doctors removed her hair; she is upset and crying by hugging his father. I still remember that visual, and it's really hard to forget.

I don’t know. Why did this happen to these kids, who didn’t see anything in their lives? I had a that was why god was so harsh on them. To be honest, I scolded god.

## Highlights of this week 💫

When I compare it with my last week, this week was good in terms of work, process, and learning.

I’ve completed the book Who Will Cry When You Die by Robin Sharma; although the content in the book doesn’t really relate to the title, it was a good read. One of the lessons that I've learned from this book is life is not all about work; its about spending time by doing what you love, building relationships, and helping others.

I’ve watched two TED talks, and one stuck with me; I’ve listened to this twice: Life is Easy, but we are making hard.

Learn a Lesson that No Matter the Age, the disease will come to you, and by the end of the day, everyone is going to die, and you can’t change anything, so live a good life when you are alive.

I hired a good folk to handle some of my work.

Deleted all the Social Media Apps and wanted to be a normal person.

## Learnings of the Week 🌱

One of the important lessons that I’ve learned from this week is about “ Life.” Anything can wait, but your health won’t, so take care of your body. It’s the only place that you have to live.

Read it again, and think It’s the only place that you have to live.

At the beginning of the week, I went to the Cancer Hospital, and I saw a lot of people who had Cancer; some were crying, some had no idea what I was. It's a strange experience for me.

We don’t know when we are going to die, but as far as we live on this earth, we should live a happy life.

This is the quote that I really love reading every day. My Father always said, “You will never hear anyone on Their death bed say I wish I had worked more.”

## Book Summary 📖

This week, I finished reading the book “ Who Will Cry When You Die” by Robin Sharma.

There is no relationship between the title and the content of the book, but it was a good read; you will learn a lot.

One of the things that I’ve learned is that small actions that you do make your life joyful.

A small action of calling your mom

A small action of sending a letter to a friend

A small action of waving your hands on the school bus

A small action is paying someone’s bill at the grocery store.

You don’t need to do extraordinary things to make your life great; just by doing some tiny actions can make your life happy and meaningful.

Take some time to enjoy your life; it's okay to take leave.. always remember Life is not a run race that you will complete in 100m or 200m; life is a marathon, and you don’t know how far it is, so whenever you feel tired, take rest and recharge your body.

Never watch the news in the morning or late at night before you are sleeping. I’ve heard this from successful people.

In our society, more people will choose to watch the criminal trial of a celebrity rather than the biography of a truly great human being.

There are a lot of things that I can share from this book, but I highly suggest reading this one.

## Person of the Week 👤

This week has been really busy, and I didn’t have a chance to talk with anybody, but one guy who really inspired and made this week more meaningful is the TED EX speaker that I’ve shared above, Jon.

Jon is a farmer from northeastern Thailand. He founded the Pun Pun Center for Self-reliance, an organic farm outside Chiang Mai, with his wife, Peggy Reents, in 2003.

Pun Pun doubles as a center for sustainable living and seed production, aiming to bring indigenous and rare seeds back into use.

It regularly hosts training on simple techniques to live more sustainably. Outside of Pun Pun, Jon is a spokesperson on dozens of publications and TV programs for the past ten years.

He continually strives to find easier ways for people to fulfill their basic needs.

You can listen to his talk here - [Link](#). It is definitely worth watching.
