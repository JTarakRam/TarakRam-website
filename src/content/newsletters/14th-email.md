# Hey Everyone,

I got some input on my newsletter from the readers, and it was good to see that some people were really reading what I was writing.

Iâ€™m actually on the bus and writing this one. ðŸ˜ƒ

After so many days, I went back to my home; it was a wonderful experience. I donâ€™t know why, but I felt very productive and happy when I was in my village; I could talk to the people, roam here and there with my friends, and talk to my parents and could do a lot more work than I do now in cities. My mind & body are so habituated to my room because I made it that way; I have a whiteboard where I clearly write the notes that I have to do, a place to read books, a place for meetings and workâ€”everything is in one room only.

Last week, I didnâ€™t write the newsletter because one of my close friends died in an accident (**please wear a helmet when you are going fast**). One of the strange parts is that I didnâ€™t even go to see him, and I feel so sad about that and hate myself. But one of the worst things about entrepreneurship is that you canâ€™t give the time, and you are busy with the work. I kind of feel that I was just running like others and not living life.  

That's why I want to take advice from **Jon**, who I personally admire for his thoughts and the way he lives a peaceful and happy life. Iâ€™m doing a podcast with him as wellâ€”hope you watch that too.

## Exciting Podcast Guests Coming Up!
I am going to bring some cool people on the podcast. Stay tuned for that! Iâ€™m telling you personally, these videos are going to help you in many ways. Iâ€™m not doing this for views or anythingâ€”since the beginning of this podcast, Iâ€™ve been spending money from my personal pocket every month, but there are no issues. I hope these videos might help at least one personâ€”that would be really good.

## A Conversation with a YC & Thiel Fellow
This week, I had a call with a founder who was a **Thiel fellow, YC-funded, and featured in Forbes**. We just had a cool conversation about some good ideas. One of the things that Iâ€™ve noticed is that he is simple and even listened to my suggestions and ideas. Maybe that's the quality that everyone should develop: **"Listen."**

## How Far Can You Trust Someone?
I have had this feeling for a long time now, and Iâ€™m struggling with this: **"How far can you trust someone?"** One thing is for sureâ€”you should trust another person to get things done. But my question is, *how far?* Because sometimes they may just leave in the middle, and you have no idea what is happening.  

Do you have any suggestions on this?

## Donâ€™t Play Safe ðŸš€
You might say,  

> **"Tarak, I was the only person that I needed to earn money, and my parents trusted me to take care of them."**  

I completely agree with you.  

But your 20s is the age to **explore and try different things**. It is *not* the time to settle in an ordinary job and do it for the next 40 years. Itâ€™s time to **experience** and figure out what you are truly passionate about because you donâ€™t have big responsibilities until you are 25 or 26.  

You might say, **"How do I feed my family?"**  

I want to be really honest with youâ€”donâ€™t get me wrong here: if they can pay your college fees and expenses, Iâ€™m pretty sure that they can take care of themselves without needing you until they have the energy.  

Imagine getting a job, buying a car + house, and living your life to pay **EMIs for the next 40 years**. And then you canâ€™t exit to start something youâ€™re truly passionate about because you have to pay **EMIs and expenses**â€”these wonâ€™t let you do it.

I hope this gets you thinking about your life. The majority of our lifespanâ€”when we have energy and clarityâ€”is from **20 to 60 years**. Thatâ€™s **40 years**, which is **almost 70% of your living life**. Itâ€™s important to **work on yourself** and do the things you really love.

Take **risks**, because **great rewards come from great risks.**

The only request I have:  
**If this newsletter is helpful to you and you are learning something from this, please share it with your friends and family.** Iâ€™m genuinely putting a lot of effort here ðŸ˜Š  

If you have anything to say personally, you can reach out to me on **LinkedIn** or **Instagram**â€”I would love to hear your thoughts.  

### Okay then, see ya later!
