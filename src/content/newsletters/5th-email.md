# Hello, my Friend,

This week, my professional life has been totally f\*cked up, but my personal life is really exciting, and I’m happy.

I don’t know why I am not able to finish the tasks as before, and I’m finding it hard to concentrate on things; since I’ve shifted to a new flat, I’m struggling to find a place where I can sit peacefully and get things done.

I have a lot of things to do, but there is something that is stopping me; I kind of feel that I’ve lost that moment, and the thing is, the tasks are not urgent, and I’m the person who decides that the things have to be done or not, I need to train my mind and got into the attitude of get things done.

I learned that Offline business is harder and more exciting than online business. You can see everything what’s going on, and you can really enjoy doing it. I found that people judge on your appearance.

When you spend time with the same mindset of people, you really don’t know the time. And it's really hard to find people with the same mindset; I kind of think that I found one with the same mindset, but I'm not sure.

Nothing teaches you character better than generosity; when you help someone, the feeling that you get is beyond your imagination, and you can’t buy that with the money.

I made some silly mistakes, and when I think about those, I’ll laugh like anything.

## Learnings of the Week 🌱

I don’t know exactly when I decided to be myself, I became the kind of person who mostly doesn’t care what other people think about me, and I mostly wear slippers, track pants, and T-shirts all the time and when I go to talk to the bank manager about my business, I could clearly see that he is judging me based on my appearance.

I kind of get a feeling that I never wear even a pant and always wear neckless t-shirts when I meet the founders who run million-dollar companies, and they really appreciate and thank me for spending my time with them. This guy judged me based on my appearance and showed some disrespect. (it’s a strange feeling which makes me laugh )

Now, it is a fight inside me that to get a good business, I need to wear good shirts and appear good to the people. I don’t know let’s see what happens.

## When you spend time with the same mindset people, you never know how fast time flies, I have the privilege that I kind of feel that I met a person who mostly has the same mindset as me ( not fully ) this week, and we shared some good ideas, and we mostly talked about startups, marketing and a lot of stuff.

I gave a word to someone a few months back: “Believe me, you're gonna get something worth it." to keep this word, I’ve helped in whatever way I can. Even though I didn’t have a bike, and even though it was raining hard, I still went out and got the bike, rode the bike in full rain, and helped.

As I said, Nothing teaches you character better than generosity. I’ve read somewhere that the most selfish thing you can do yourself is to help others; the feeling and the gratification that you get can’t be bought, and you won’t get anywhere.

## This video will change your perception of how you spend your life on your screen.

**[Video Link](#)**

We spend 15 years just scrolling through Social Media; If you tick off all the time buckets that you have, you are only left with nearly 130 buckets in your lifetime which you are free, and the fact is we are filling 121 buckets with just scrolling our screens which means simply we are wasting 95% of our productive time to do the things that we dreamed for.

## Whenever I have time, I’ll simply go to my notion and start writing the things that I’m doing and ask myself genuinely, are you really interested in doing this, and do you enjoy doing it? something I’ve noticed is whatever I’m doing now, I never feel even one day that I’m doing the work, because I love what I’m doing. and it was a lot of fun for me.

I agree that there are a lot of problems that will arise in the future, but I don’t want to disappoint my present for the future, who knows what will happen in the next minute.

## Book Summary 📖

This week, I started reading the book “ The Way Of The Wolf ” by Jordan Belford

It is one of the best sales books that you can get, he talks about a straight-line system where if anyone wants to buy something from you, they not only see the product but see you, the background, the brand, and a lot of stuff, and it’s really important for the salesperson to satisfy the customer in every way to close the deal.

He talks a points table from 1 to 10, where the customer will check the list from 1 to 10, and if the customer can come up above 7, then there is a good chance that you can close the deal. and if the customer is below 4, then it will be hard to close the deal. and most of the people are between 4 - and 6. This is where your skills come in.

sometimes, the customers don’t know what they need, and sometimes, you don’t know what exactly their problem is, so there are a lot of things that matter when you are trying to close the deal. and it can’t be learned in one day It easily takes years to learn and be good at it.

## Person of the Week 👤

The Person of this Week is Sreeragh, who is the founder and CTO of Bizmo, An AI website builder. He is one of the best developers that I’ve seen

One of the interesting things about him is he didn’t even complete his 12th and didn’t come from a tech background. He learned to code 8 months back and built a platform in 4 months that takes at least 6 months to build for an entire team.

I think he got 10+ Offers from companies ( international & national ) who are willing to pay him a 2L a-month salary, and he got some requests from the VC firms also for his startup.

He is one of the best examples that I can give that you don’t need a degree to get a job and to do great things.
