## Hey Buddy,

This is the week I feel I’m so special; I’m lucky, I’m happy, I’m healthy, and I feel like I am different from others.

It is very important to think like this since we live in a world where we forget how to live a simple life; we are always running for something. Just stop and feel how amazing it is to see the blue sky, the green trees, and a bright morning. How amazing it is to call your family and your friends.

There is a wonderful book called *The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down.* I recommend everyone read this book; we forget to slow down and experience life, so always remember my friend. **Today is the youngest you’ll ever be again.**

Even though yesterday has passed, you still have time to make today and tomorrow count. So have fun with it.

- Try that new hobby out.
- Play a new sport.
- Try to start that business.
- Make some new friends.
- Just have some fun.
- Travel to that place.
- And make every moment count.

I always used to think that I was not doing enough and that I was in the right way, but when I look back just nine months back, from the start of 2024, I have achieved a lot.

- I started doing podcasts with some great people, and now I’m in the top 1% of podcasters in the world because many podcasters never finished 20+ episodes, but I did.
- I started writing a Newsletter, where I share some of my thoughts and journey with the people, and I get some good responses from the people, which means there are people that genuinely read what I wrote on the internet.
- I started developing the app, and now it is uploaded to the App Store and Play Store (it is now in review).
- I started an offline business in the span of three months, generating six-figure revenue.
- I started writing in a diary this year and wrote almost every day, and it became a habit for me.
- I flew on a plane for the first time; I visited Kedarnath and enjoyed it a lot.
- I partnered with one UK senior scientist to build a web app, and we made it happen and released it to the public.
- I have some good clients who are willing to pay for the use of my service.
- I met a lot of people along the way, had countless meetings, and had a lot of fun as well as struggle.
- Read more than 24+ Books.
- Had three job opportunities.

All these were done in just under nine months; when I stopped and started seeing from different angles, I felt wowed and felt like I was so special and fortunate to work on different things and learn from my experiences.

Just a small shift of focus made my day, and I am happy now; we live in a world where we focus more on the negative things rather than on the good things that we have.

> There is a lot more good in this world than bad things. It is like a whiteboard, and you forget to concentrate on the good things like the whole whiteboard, but you only focus on the black dots on that whiteboard, just like focusing on your problems. See how amazing it is to live today; yesterday there were more than 1500 people who died.

I’m going to repeat it again: **Today is the youngest you’ll ever be; now you are 5 minutes older than you were when you started reading this newsletter. Every minute that you spend is worth it.**

If you really want to live a happy life by focusing on the present moment, then I definitely recommend *Four Thousand Weeks.* After reading this book, I guarantee you will see the world entirely differently, your priorities will change, you will live more in the present moment, and you will stop worrying about things that never happened to you.

To be honest, I have a lot of things in my mind to share, but the only problem is here. I don’t get the feeling of writing heartfully when I sit on my laptop; I really love to write on paper; I’m so lucky to read my own diary because I can see past in it, how I think, how it feels that day, what actions did I take.

For you, I’ll just go through a random page.

### It was Friday, Feb 16th.

> Today is not bad, but it was the most stressful day out there. Idk why this is not right, man; I’m missing something; why am I not happy? Is it money? Is it a girlfriend? Is it the team? Is it clients or the startup?
>
> I need one person to say all my things, who is that person? It has been years since I cried, I know why I am not able to cry. Also, I need to enjoy the things that I am doing. I did my morning routine but missed reading the book, had a meeting with the Swa Team and talked about the content, and was planning to visit Kerala once I get the money from the client.

> Good night, Tarak; you gotta work hard, man… Okay!!

When I read this, I felt I was talking to myself, and it was a great feeling. I suggest you start writing a diary; it only takes **15 min every day**, but when you see the benefits, you will thank me.

### **Question for you 🫵**

If you switch off your mobile for a week and you don’t contact anyone, **who will be looking for you?**

### **Books 📖**

I’ve listed two books; I don’t want to write a summary for these books because I want everyone to read them because when you read, you will understand based on your situation.

Back then, when I read *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, I didn’t like it because I was mostly online and hardly met any people in person, but now when I read it again, I felt so interested and useful.

That is why I’m telling you to read these books so that you will understand and attach them to your life based on your current situation and start changing it.

- *The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down.*
- *Four Thousand Weeks.*

### **Podcast 🎙️**

This week I did a podcast with **Sahil Sachidev**, who was the founder of **Level UP PR**. He had the privilege of working with one of the greatest entrepreneurs, **Robert Kiyosaki**, the author of *Rich Dad Poor Dad*.

We talked about how he started, the mistakes he made along the way, his mindset, his experience when he met **Robert Kiyosaki and Aman Gupta**, and a lot more…

If you enjoy these podcasts, **give them a like and subscribe**; one thing I can promise is that whatever I get, I’ll invest in making it the best.

### **Favourite Quotes 💙**

> *The reality is neither good nor bad - it is simply as it is. We must embrace the uncertainty of existence and find freedom in the unknown.*

> *The second half of a man’s life is made up of nothing but the habits he has acquired during the first half.*

> *Schools are for the mental, not for the heart and creativity.*

I’m special, and **you are too**; we all are here to make this world a beautiful place.
