## Hey Champion, how are you?

Iâ€™m sorry I couldnâ€™t find time to write my previous newsletter that had to be published on Monday since I was traveling the whole week and not feeling well.

So, in these two weeks, a lot of things happened in my life: a lot of lessons were learned, and I had new experiences, highlights, and a lot moreâ€¦

In my last email, we stopped in Delhi, right? I had just published while I was traveling in the metro to Kedarnath.

It was a dream for me for quite a long time to visit Kedarnathâ€”not for the temple, but to experience nature and enjoy the beauty of the mountains.

Finally, I traveled to Kedarnath and Badrinath. While we were returning, people said that it was a dream for a lot of people to visit these temples once in a lifetime when they opened on the first day. And we are so lucky that we went both on the opening day.

## Highlights of This Week

A lot of new things happened during these two weeks:

- Growing up in a village, I knew it was a big thing to fly on a plane. Although Iâ€™m an entrepreneur with multiple businesses that give me good revenue, it was still a big milestone for me. Finally, I flew on a plane.
- Visited Kedarnath and Badrinath temples (Traveled 3000+ km).
- From a stranger I met online a year ago to a friend who then became a co-founder of my marketing agencyâ€”finally met him in person.
- Attended a webinar that changed my entire thinking about building and scaling a business.
- We have a new client this week.
- Taken a new franchise.

## Learnings of the Week

- **Health is the most important thing.** Even if you have money and resources, without good health, you can't enjoy life or explore new places.
- **Systems are crucial in business.** I attended a webinar on running a business effectively. It was eye-opening because I realized that fear and confusion often hold me back from making necessary changes.
- **Things take longer than expected.** My uncle and I took a franchise, thinking it would take ten days, but we faced many challenges along the way. Finally, it got accepted yesterday.
- **Learn to say NO.** I often say YES to too many things, leading to overwork. Iâ€™ve been sleeping only 4 hours a day for the past three days. Remember, when you say YES, you need to think about the price you pay later.

## Book Summary: *The Diary of a CEO* by Steven Bartlett

This week, I started reading *The Diary of a CEO*. Itâ€™s more than a business bookâ€”itâ€™s a guide that talks about the 33 laws of business and life. The book is divided into four pillars:

- **The Self** â€“ Mastering self-awareness, self-control, self-care, and self-esteem.
- **The Story** â€“ Understanding storytelling to persuade people to follow, trust, and buy from you.
- **The Philosophy** â€“ Core principles and beliefs that guide behavior towards success.
- **The Team** â€“ Building a strong team bound by the right culture, where 1 + 1 = 3.

Iâ€™ll share deeper insights after I finish the book.
