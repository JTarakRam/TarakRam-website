# Hello Everyone,

I'm sorry I didn’t have a chance to send my newsletter this past week since I got dengue, and my situation is worse; now, slowly, I’m feeling better and kind of okay.

Last week, I went to my home, and I don’t know, but I really love the village environment more than the city; I’ll have a productive time there and enjoy myself with my friends, and I feel happier there. I’m trying to do the same in the cities as well, but I'm struggling to find the right environment.

A few months back, when I started reading the Atomic Habits book, I wrote in my book that if you want to change the habit, change the environment first, not the habit and I totally argue with that since it all depends on where you live; if you are in a bad environment, I promise you that you won’t concentrate and won’t be happy.

But if you are in a good environment where you feel happy, you will find productivity and peace. No matter how much money you get at the end of the day, are you happy, and are you really enjoying doing the work?

## Highlights of this week 💫

When it comes to highlights of this week, as I said, I got dengue, so I went home and spent some good time with my family & Friends.

- I watched two films (both are Malayalam, and I don’t understand one word, but I’m really obsessed with these people). If you look at my LinkedIn profile, you will find more people from Kerala.
- Read two books; “Hell Yeah or No: What’s Worth Doing” & “Anything You Want.”
- I emailed Derek, who was the author of these books, and he said he would love to meet me when he comes to Hyd.
- Inspired a lot by the Airbnb Story.
- Published the podcast; go and check my YouTube channel.
- This week, I opened my Instagram to see how my social media manager is working on my laptop, and I didn’t see anything that was super worthwhile there, and it became so obvious to stop using it.

## Learnings of the Week 🌱

One of the best learnings of this week from my personal experience and the book that I read said the same thing. “When you trust people, first verify.”

I don’t want to mention the names and go deeper, but I’ll give an overall thing so that It might help you in your relationships or any work, etc. I have one good and bad thing about trusting people. One of the sad things about me is I don’t trust people easily, but if I trust them, then I’ll give them all, like my passwords, emails, etc.… and the important thing is the freedom so that they don’t need my permission to do everything.

Some people will take this as an advantage and start cheating you, and some people take this as a benefit and work like theirs. So, it has both good and bad sides, and interestingly, I saw both this week.

Although I’ve read books, worked for some time, and watched movies, this week is one of the lowest weeks since I don’t know, but I got a worse feeling and thought about what I was doing with my life; if I need only the money then I would have done a job now earning more than a lakh simply from my village and not going anywhere, but I don’t want that there is something which is great that pushes me to take the risk even though there is a high chance of failing.

I really don’t know if all these are worth it or not, but I am doing all these without thinking about the output, even this newsletter; I have 50 subscribers, but I spend 5 hours every week writing this. If I calculate my hourly rate, then it is worth a few thousand, but I am simply writing this because I really love sharing my thoughts here.

Until now, I had never felt that I was working. To be honest, whatever I have done so far, I really enjoy doing those things; sometimes, I have meetings at 2 am and 3 am, but these days, I’m making my highest priority my health over anything. I’m like fun & doing things like I’m not putting in any hard work. These days, I have a feeling like, am I really working hard? 😅

## Random Thoughts 🫠

One of the random thoughts of this week is (I posted this on my LinkedIn, too):

**Life is not a Race where you end in 100m or 200m; It’s a path that you never know where it ends.**

Some people will say that life is a race, you gotta kind of attitude, you need to work your ass off to get things. So most people run for materialistic success like I’ll work hard until I get a good house, I’ll work hard until I get a Mercedes, so whatever.

When you get those, then what do you do afterward? You don’t live like before; you don’t have the motivation to work.

See, Life is like a marathon; sometimes you need to rest, sometimes you need to run, and sometimes you need to stop.

I want to frame it like this.

Let’s say there are two friends, “Ram” & “Tarak.” They started their journey.

Ram loves to go in a car on the highway, and Tarak loves to walk in the woods and experience nature.

Ram, who went in the car, might say that I’ve traveled 100km more than Tarak and felt proud of it.

But Tarak, who walked in the woods, experienced nature, woods, animals, waterfall, and a lot more, and really enjoyed the journey.

When Ram is mocking at Tarak, he said:

> Maybe you might have traveled a lot by exploring less, and you even hardly remember what you have seen besides the road, but I traveled less but explored more; I enjoyed every step of my journey.

Life is exactly the same; some people earn cores of rupees, and they don’t explore and enjoy the journey, but some people who have earned only a few lakhs really enjoy and explore.

## Book Summary 📖

This week, I’ve learned a lot about Life, business, and a lot more. To be honest, this week is one of the best weeks so far for reading since I got more time due to dengue, and I completed two books. It is not about completing the book in one day or one week. There are a few books that took me more than a month, and there are a few books that I completed in one day; it totally depends on the book.

I can’t write all that I’ve learned since It’s going to take three newsletters to complete, but I’ll try to give an overall idea.

### The First Book: “Anything You Want”

This book changed my whole perception of running a business; one of the best things that matches my philosophy is, **Do you really enjoy doing this?** **Is it making you happy and excites you?**

You don’t need a lot of investment to run a business; you can start with one simple website or even WhatsApp or phone calls; most people have the misconception that you need a lot of employees and a lot of investment to run a business. You need customers first rather than anything. If you have customers who are willing to pay to use your service, then you have a business.

You should always ask these questions: **Is my customer happy? My customers really enjoy my service.** If you can keep your customers happy, then you have a good business than 90% of the businesses here in the world.

I have a lot of things to say about this book, but it’s always worth reading it; if you really want to read this book, then email me, and I’ll send the free PDFs.

### The Second Book: “Hell Yeah or No: What’s Worth Doing”

Sometimes, we have a problem saying YES to things even though we really enjoy doing them. I, too, suffered from this problem by saying YES to many things.

From the title, you can understand that if it really excites you, which means you have to feel like, **Hell yeah, it’s super exciting; I need to get this done**, then only say YES; otherwise, the simple answer is NO.

I’m telling you this one thing: you can save a lot of time.

See, it is simple to self-reflect on the things that you are doing if you have free time. But if you are busy doing the things that you don’t like doing, which ruins your peace and happiness, and even though something that excites you comes, you can’t work because you are doing the things that don’t really matter to you.

The more time you have, the more you can work on the things that you truly love and which matter the most to you.

If you really want to read these books, then email me, and I’ll send the free PDFs.

## Person of the Week 👤

The person of this week is **Derek Sivers**, who was the author of the books I’ve read: “Hell Yeah or No: What’s Worth Doing” & “Anything You Want,” and the founder of CDBaby. I really love the way how he started his business, and he never wanted it to grow more because he loved what he was doing, and he is 100% satisfied.

One of the best things that I really love about Derek is he is a man of consistent effort; he learned music for more than 25 years to become a singer, and he has published many songs. 99% of people said that he couldn’t become a singer since his voice was bad.

He shows another perception of running a business to the world; most people think that running a business means you need to have a great idea and a great team to solve big problems and make huge money, but that’s not true.

Even if you look at some successful businesses, they don’t really have extraordinary ideas and solve big problems; they solve small problems, and the idea seems very simple.

He taught me a lot about living life, running a business that won’t ruin your life and happiness, and a lot more.

## Podcast 🎙️

Last week, I did a podcast with Dr. Urvisha, who was the founder of Passision Healthcare Solutions, which mainly focuses on clinical research in healthcare. I asked some honest questions regarding Doctors, Clinical research, why they wrote like that, mentality, and a lot more.

If you enjoy these podcasts, give them a like and subscribe; one thing I can promise is that whatever I get, I’ll invest in making it the best.
