# Hope you are healthy and working on your dreams,

So far, this is one of the most honest and brutal newsletters that comes directly from my heart.

I don’t know how to frame it from my brain so that you will understand, but here is the thing.

Please don’t get involved in a lot of things, which means multi-tasking. You might say, "I can work up to 2 AM; I am very energetic, I am very clever," etc... but listen. I was the person who worked till 3 - 4 AM every day in every aspect, like marketing, dealing with international clients, and building things.

Yesterday, my friend got a fever and was on bed rest for one week. I was the only person taking care of our offline business, and yesterday, I worked like hell, honestly. Maybe most of you don’t know that I’ve taken the courier franchise because it might help the DeleMate app I’m working on.

So when I was bringing the deliveries or going with my delivery boy, and you better know how the people are here—who have **gutka** in their mouth and don’t know how to speak properly—at that minute, I just realized, *“What the heck are you doing, Tarak?”* You were the person who spoke to founders and some brilliant minds from all around the world, and I really had a feeling that I was stuck here and thought, *"As soon as possible, I need to get rid of this, man."*

That moment was just an eye-opener for me. I am saying this because I failed to say **NO** back then, and now I’m paying the price.

I always say that you should learn how to say **NO**. You will get a lot more freedom and time to work on yourself by saying **NO**. Sometimes, I don’t have time to write this newsletter as well because back then, I was so ambitious and wanted to do some crazy stuff, and so I said **YES** to many things. Now I’m paying the price. Even my podcasts—I am not doing them properly because of the time.

It’s easy to be busy with a lot of stuff like me, and it's easy to concentrate on one thing.

I said **YES** to some projects, so what I need to be productive is just to **block my calendar and do focused work at that time**. That's the only solution that I found and am working on.

At first, it's easy for me, but if things are working and getting in shape, you need to dedicate a lot of time here, and you don’t have that much time. So this is my personal experience—**if you want to start something, then just go for it until you see it through.**

The problem is this: I can work up to 3 AM every day, but **I don’t have the energy to work.** All my energy is draining down, and it’s really hard for me to be productive these days.

### One of our subscribers asked me: *"Tarak, what are you doing? You never actually told us."*  
Here it is:

- I run **Skale with AI** – It’s a marketing agency where we help businesses bring more clients (we had a collaboration with a UK Real Estate Agent)  
  🚫 *Stopped this completely because of time*  
- I am developing an app called **DeleMate**, which is a peer-to-peer delivery app where users can earn money while traveling.  
- I am working with a **UK senior scientist** to build a marketplace for a specific niche.  
- I have a **Courier Franchise**.  
- I do **Podcasts** and write **Newsletters**.  
- BTW, I **read books every day**. 📚  

You might think, *wow,* but when it comes to contributing to every project, it takes a lot of time, hard work, and dedication.

I think this is the first time that I revealed to everyone what I was doing. No one knows till now. I don’t know, but I feel it’s worth sharing with you since I believe there are people who are genuinely learning something from this newsletter.

I made the mistake of choosing **too many things at one time**; please don’t make this mistake. Otherwise, you will suffer like me—struggling to find time and energy.

### Another thing I want to talk about is: *"What do you really want?"*  
If you are clear about this, you are ahead of **99%** of people.  

Just ask yourself this question:  
**What do you really want?**  

- Is it **Money**?  
- Is it a **Good Relationship**?  
- Is it **Happiness**?  
- Is it **Social Status**?  

Every person is different, and they have different choices.

If you know what you really want, then you won’t chase unnecessary things, and you will be **more clear and happier** than ever before.

As I said, I was searching for this question: *What do I really want?* Is it money? Of course, money is important, but personally, for me, **happiness and freedom come first.**

I don’t want **millions of dollars when I’m 60.** I don’t even know if I’ll be alive at that age or not. But **until I’m alive, I want to live happily with freedom**, which means that **no one should control my life**.

If I want to go and live in a van for a month, I just go for it. 🚐 If I want to do something crazy, I’ll just do it. And I know—and I can feel from the bottom of my heart—that **I’ll have financial freedom at some point in my life**. (*Since I have equity and I’m not an employee 🙂*)  

I thought, *let’s see what it looks like if I work for money for six months*, and I’m trying to be like that as much as possible, but I don’t know—I may quit. If I only wanted money, I’d be doing a job now that pays me more than a lakh per month.

I feel very happy, and I get a good feeling when I am writing this newsletter. Otherwise, I wouldn’t do this 😄, definitely. **It’s not for the money—it’s for myself.**  

I have a lot of things to share, but I don’t know if it’s the right time to share them or not.
